# Large Language Models Course: Hands on learnign building projects.
I'm currently developing a course on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications. This repository will house all the notebooks utilized throughout the course.

The course provides a hands-on experience using models from OpenAI and the Hugging Face library. We are going to see and use a lot of tools and practice with small projects that will grow as we can apply the new knowledge"

Some of the topics and technologies covered in the course include:
 
* Chatbots. 

* Code Generation. 

* Vector databases.

* LangChain.

* Fine-tuning.

* Transfer Learning. 

* Knowdledge Distillation.

Each notebook is supported with a Medium article where the code is explained in detail. 

## Create Your First Chatbot Using GPT 3.5, OpenAI, Python and Panel.
We will be utilizing OpenAI GPT-3.5 and Panel to develop a straightforward Chatbot tailored for a fast food restaurant. During the course, we will explore the fundamentals of prompt engineering, including understanding the various OpenAI roles, manipulating temperature settings, and how to avoid Prompt Injections.

## How to Create a Natural Language to SQL Translator Using OpenAI API.
Following the same framework utilized in the previous article to create the ChatBot, we made a few modifications to develop a Natural Language to SQL translator. In this case, the Model needs to be provided with the table structures, and adjustments were made to the prompt to ensure smooth functionality and avoid any potential malfunctions.

With these modifications in place, the translator is capable of converting natural language queries into SQL queries.
